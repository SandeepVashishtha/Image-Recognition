# Real-time Object Recognition with TensorFlow and OpenCV

 

## Overview

This project enables real-time object recognition using a webcam, powered by TensorFlow and OpenCV. The system identifies and classifies objects in live video streams, making it versatile for applications like security systems, robotics, and interactive installations.

Check out the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SandeepVashishtha/Image-Recognition) for more details.

## Features

- **Real-time Processing:** The system processes video frames in real-time for instantaneous object recognition.

- **TensorFlow Integration:** Leverage TensorFlow's deep learning capabilities for accurate and efficient object classification.

- **OpenCV Webcam Interaction:** Utilize OpenCV to seamlessly interact with the webcam, making it easy to integrate into various applications.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/SandeepVashishtha/Image-Recognition.git
    cd Image-Recognition
    ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow
    ```
    ```bash
    pip install opencv
    ```

3. **Run the Real-time Object Recognition:**

    ```bash
    python realtime_object_recognition.py
    ```

   The code will automatically initiate the webcam feed, allowing you to experience real-time object recognition directly.
